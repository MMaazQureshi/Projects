# Finds Minimum no. of substrings required to make a string
This Algorithm is Written by Me(Muhammad Maaz Qureshi) for an online algorithm test feel free to use any issues spotted/resolve will be welcomed
it takes two strings as arguments one is initial and one is goal
this algorithm return total no. of substrings made from a required to make goal string if possible or -1 if not possible for e.g:
test input: initial = abc,goal=abcabba
output: 4
test input: initial = abc,goal=abcabcba
output: 4
test input: initial = abc,goal=dabcabba
output: -1
